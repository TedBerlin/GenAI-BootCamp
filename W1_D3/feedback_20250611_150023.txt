suggestions for improvement:
- In `find_oldest_cat`, using a more Pythonic approach like `max()` with a key function would improve readability and efficiency.
- Add docstrings to all functions to improve code readability and understanding.
- In Exercise 2, consider using a more descriptive name for the `height` attribute, like `height_cm`.
- The `Dog` class's `__gt__`, `__lt__`, and `__eq__` methods could be consolidated into a single comparison method for better code organization.
- In Exercise 4, error handling could be improved. For example, check for empty input in `add_animal`, `sell_animal`, and `sort_animals`.
- For Exercise 4, consider using a more efficient data structure for `animal_groups` if the zoo has a very large number of animals. A list comprehension might make the code in `sort_animals` more concise.
- The variable names in Exercise 4 could be more descriptive (e.g., `zoo_animals` instead of `animals`).
