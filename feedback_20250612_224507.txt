suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 3, consider adding more robust input validation to handle cases where the user might enter unexpected input (e.g., numbers, special characters).
- In Exercise 4, the output message for the else condition could be improved for clarity.  Instead of "Sorry, {145 - height:.1f} cm are left. You need to grow a littele bit more to ride", consider something like "You need to grow {145 - height:.1f} more centimeters to ride."
- Exercise 6 is correctly pointed out as an example of immutability, but adding a brief explanation in the code itself would enhance understanding. A comment explaining why appending to a tuple fails would be beneficial.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises directly address the problems stated in the chapter content.  Each exercise correctly uses the specified data types and programming concepts (loops, conditionals, lists, sets, tuples). The code accurately implements the functionality described in each exercise, demonstrating a complete understanding of the chapter's topics.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow.  Variable names are mostly descriptive, and the code is well-commented, however, some minor improvements in messaging could be made as per feedback.
- performance: The code is efficient for the tasks it performs. No significant performance issues are apparent. The algorithms used are appropriate for the problem sizes and the code runs quickly.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.  The code does not handle user input in a way that could be exploited.  The current level of security is sufficient for the scope of these exercises.
