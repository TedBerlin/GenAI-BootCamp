suggestions for improvement:
- The `rock-paper-scissors.py` file is missing, which is a crucial part of the project as outlined in the instructions.  The provided code only implements the `game.py` portion.
- The `play()` method in the `Game` class should return a string in the format 'win;draw;loss', as specified in the instructions. Currently, it returns only 'win', 'loss', or 'draw'.
- Add more comprehensive error handling and input validation in `rock-paper-scissors.py` (when it's implemented) to ensure robustness.
- Consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of each function and block of code in both `game.py` and `rock-paper-scissors.py` for better readability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `main()` function could be improved by separating the game loop from the menu handling and result processing. This would enhance modularity and readability.
- The `print_results` function should handle the case where no games have been played to avoid errors.
- Add more comprehensive error handling for user input, especially in the `get_user_menu_choice()` function. Consider handling potential exceptions during file operations (if any).
